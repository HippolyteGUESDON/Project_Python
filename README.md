# Project_Python

Hello, welcome to our Python final project, we hope you will enjoy it. 

We first of all analysed the data we had to deal with: the different levels of obesity in function of different factor such as smoking, the way people go to work, how many hour they watch tv each day etc...
We tried to do graph that were the most relevent to us, so we could conclude and observe unusual things in the dataset.

Our classifications are a K neightbors and a Random forest. 

Check out our power point for precise details on our analysis ! 
Hope you will enjoy it ! 

Thanks for your attention
